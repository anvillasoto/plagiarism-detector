# Plagiarism Project, Machine Learning Deployment

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying a plagiarism detector using AWS SageMaker.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either *plagiarized* or *not*, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. Detecting plagiarism is an active area of research; the task is non-trivial and the differences between paraphrased answers and original work are often not so obvious.

This project will be broken down into three main notebooks:

**Notebook 1: Data Exploration**
* Load in the corpus of plagiarism text data.
* Explore the existing data features and the data distribution.
* This first notebook is **not** required in your final project submission.

**Notebook 2: Feature Engineering**

* Clean and pre-process the text data.
* Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.
* Select "good" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.
* Create train/test `.csv` files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.

**Notebook 3: Train and Deploy Your Model in SageMaker**

* Upload your train/test feature data to S3.
* Define a binary classification model and a training script.
* Train your model and deploy it using SageMaker.
* Evaluate your deployed classifier.

## Notes from the Implementer:

1. If there are inconsistencies, redundancies or grammatical errors that would affect the score of my submission, please point it out to me judiciously.
2. This is MY OWN WORK with basis from the course's notebooks, PyTorch forums, StackOverflow answers, Medium posts about binary classification and Udacity's knowledge panel answers. If you think that I did something against the terms of your rules to plagiarism or anything  that is within the Udacity honor code, kindly let me know.
